        <p>My name is Korene Stuart.  I am a mom of three and a student programmer.  I am currently in a program sponsored by a non-profit program called Launchcode.  I live in South Florida and work part time as a STEM advocate.</p>
        <p>I aspire to eventually work in UX/UI but first I am learning all about the backend of things.  Our next unit in my course is Java and C##.</p>
        <p>Three things that are important about me:
            <ol>
                <li>I am an avid learner.</li>
                <li>I love spending time with my family.</li>
                <li>I love to teach.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
